### :boom: Challenges:
#### As a team we had many Challenges that we learned a lot from them:
#### :arrow_right: We had a conflict with merge in github, we tried a lot of commands to fix it.   
#### :arrow_right: It was difficult to get the data from our database as an object at the end point that we created.

### :boom: If we have more time...
#### we will work on posting the data in the browser as a rows in the table and to post an average of each cohort rating.

##### Enjoy :rose:
